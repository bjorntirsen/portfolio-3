# portfolio-3

This is my third portforlio page. It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Storyblok

I've chosen to use Storyblok as the headless CMS for this portfolio, since it offers free hosting.

To run the project locally I'm using `local-ssl-proxy` and therefore I have modified the `dev` script so it starts the proxy. This is described on Storyblok's docs here: https://www.storyblok.com/tp/add-a-headless-cms-to-next-js-13-in-5-minutes
